{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}

## Known Bugs

There are currently no know bugs at the moment.

## Technologies Used

I used HTML, CSS for the structure and layout presentation respectively, and used WOW.js and Animate.css for the animations on the site.
